## Enhanced Response Quality Checks

### Before/After Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Number
❌ **Unacceptable**: "Total revenue: $500,000"
✅ **Expected**: "Total revenue: $500,000 (up 18% from last quarter, strongest growth in 2 years)"

#### Example 2: Top Customers
❌ **Unacceptable**: Just a list of customer names
✅ **Expected**: "Top 10 customers generated $2.1M (42% of total revenue). Customer #1 alone represents 12% of all revenue."

#### Example 3: Monthly Data
❌ **Unacceptable**: "150 orders this month"
✅ **Expected**: "150 orders this month (+25% vs last month), driven by increased activity from premium segment"

---

## Success Criteria

### ✅ **PASS** if:
- Business users can get data without technical knowledge
- All responses use business language
- Complex multi-table queries work seamlessly
- Comparisons include growth rates and percentages
- Numbers always come with context
- Trends and patterns are identified proactively
- Google Sheets export works smoothly
- Alias handling is natural (smart confirmation)
- Errors are friendly and actionable
- No technical details exposed anywhere

### ❌ **FAIL** if:
- Database/table/schema names appear in ANY responses
- SQL queries are shown to users (even for complex operations)
- Technical errors shown without translation
- User needs to know database structure
- Responses use technical jargon ("tables", "schemas", "queries")
- Numbers lack context (no trends, growth rates, or comparisons)
- Agent asks redundant questions (e.g., asking for alias name twice)
- Multi-table queries don't work or expose JOIN syntax

---

## Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Error Message Leakage**: Technical errors might slip through in edge cases
2. **SQL Exposure**: Complex multi-table queries might inadvertently show SQL fragments  
3. **Table Name References**: Automated messages might reference table names
4. **Schema Confusion**: Agent might say "schema" instead of business terms
5. **Missing Context**: Numbers presented without growth rates or comparisons
6. **Redundant Questions**: Asking for confirmation then asking for the same info again

---

## Reporting Issues

When logging bugs, include:
1. **Question Asked**: Exact user input
2. **Expected Response**: What should happen (refer to test case)
3. **Actual Response**: What actually happened
4. **Technical Details Exposed**: Any database/SQL references that appeared
5. **Missing Context**: Lack of trends, comparisons, or insights
6. **UX Issues**: Redundant questions or awkward flows
7. **Severity**: 
   - **High**: Technical details exposed, SQL shown, multi-table queries fail
   - **Medium**: UX issues, missing context, awkward flows
   - **Low**: Minor formatting, spelling errors

---

---

**The agent should feel like talking to a professional business analyst, not a database!**

---

## Testing Tips & Best Practices

### Speed & Performance
- ✅ **Agent should respond quickly** - If it thinks for >10 seconds, something is wrong
- ✅ **No "thinking forever"** - Agent should attempt queries immediately
- ❌ Watch for: Agent exploring databases/tables unnecessarily before answering

### Data Quality Checks
- ✅ **Always verify actual data is shown** - Not just column headers
- ✅ **Check row counts** - Ensure all data exported, not just 1 row
- ❌ Watch for: Empty tables with only headers displayed

### Google Sheets Integration  
- ✅ **Test alias saving** - Try saving, then reading by alias
- ✅ **Test rename** - Agent should show new name + URL
- ✅ **Test chart creation** - Export trend data, ask for line chart
- ❌ Watch for: Alias name doubling ("topTentopTen")
- ❌ Watch for: Charts not appearing or wrong chart type

### Agent Behavior
- ✅ **TRY FIRST policy** - Agent should attempt complex queries before refusing
- ✅ **Business language only** - No database/table/SQL mentions
- ✅ **Export offers only when data shown** - Not when query fails
- ❌ Watch for: "I cannot calculate that" without trying
- ❌ Watch for: Offering to export data it couldn't find

### Chart Testing Scenarios
1. **Line Chart**: "Show monthly revenue trend, then create a chart"
2. **Bar Chart**: "Top 10 customers, visualize with bar chart"
3. **Pie Chart**: "Market segment breakdown, make a pie chart"

### Common Issues to Check
- [ ] Agent gives up on multi-dimensional queries without trying
- [ ] Only headers shown, no data rows
- [ ] Alias not found when it should exist
- [ ] Slow response times (>10 seconds for simple queries)
- [ ] Technical details leaked to user (database names, SQL)

### Quick Smoke Tests (Run These First)
1. "Show me sales data" - Should respond immediately
2. "Top customers" - Should query and display
3. "Export to Google Sheets" - Should create sheet with data
4. "Create a chart" - Should add visualization

**All tests should pass with fast, business-friendly responses!**
